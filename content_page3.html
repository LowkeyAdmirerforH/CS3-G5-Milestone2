        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Jinggoy Estrada</span>, son of former President Joseph Estrada, is a former Philippine senator who became embroiled in the massive Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) scam. The PDAF scam, also known as the <span class="highlight">pork barrel scam</span>, exposed how government funds intended for development projects were systematically funneled into private pockets through fraudulent schemes.

        </div>

        <p>
            In 2013, Jinggoy Estrada was accused of diverting over PHP 183 million of his PDAF allocation to fake non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operated by <span class="highlight">Janet Lim Napoles</span>. These NGOs allegedly existed only on paper, with no real projects implemented. Investigators revealed that Estrada received kickbacks in exchange for channeling funds to these bogus entities, depriving the public of much-needed services and infrastructure.

        <p>
            Estrada was arrested in 2014 and charged with <span class="highlight">plunder</span> and graft. Although he was detained for three years, he was granted bail in 2017, citing insufficient evidence of his involvement as the "main plunderer." His trial, however, continues to this day. The PDAF scam exposed the deep-rooted corruption in the Philippine political system and spurred demands for reforms in the allocation of public funds.
