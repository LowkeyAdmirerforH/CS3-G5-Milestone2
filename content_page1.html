            <span class="highlight">Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</span>, the former president who held office from 2001 to 2010, was accused of corruption both during and after her term. 
            The <span class="highlight">Fertilizer Fund Scam</span>, which reportedly involved the misappropriation of PHP 728 million in government funds meant to assist underprivileged farmers, was one of the most controversial incidents associated with her administration.

            The scam revolved around accusations that the funds, designated for fertilizer and agricultural projects, were diverted for Arroyo’s 2004 presidential campaign. 
            Investigations revealed that major portions of the budget were allegedly distributed as bribes to political allies or spent on overpriced and low-quality fertilizers. 
            Then-Agriculture Undersecretary <span class="highlight">Jocelyn “Joc-Joc” Bolante</span>, the alleged mastermind of the scheme, was accused of managing the distribution of the funds.

            Despite Arroyo's denials, the incident intensified public outrage over corruption in her government. Arroyo was eventually released from the majority of charges, including those related to the Fertilizer Fund Scam, although she faced other charges of theft and graft. 
            This case raised widespread concerns about the nation’s legal system and political responsibility.
