        <h1>The Plunder Case of Former President Joseph Estrada</h1>

        <h2>An Infamous Tale of Corruption</h2>

        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Joseph "Erap" Estrada</span>, a popular film actor turned politician, became the
            13th President of the Philippines in 1998. His presidency, however, was marred by allegations of
            corruption, culminating in his conviction for plunder in 2007. This case remains one of the most
            infamous examples of corruption in Philippine history.

                <strong>Key Point:</strong> Estrada's case highlighted the misuse of power and public funds,
                sparking a political crisis that led to his impeachment and removal from office.

            Estrada was accused of amassing over PHP 4 billion through illegal means during his presidency. This
            included accepting bribes from operators of illegal gambling operations (<span class="highlight"

            >) and diverting public funds meant for tobacco farmers into his personal accounts. Prosecutors also
            presented evidence of Estrada using dummy corporations to launder money. These allegations triggered a
            political crisis, leading to his impeachment trial in 2000.
        </p>

        <p>
            Public outrage over the trial’s suspension sparked massive protests, culminating in the peaceful
            <span class="highlight">People Power II</span> movement that ousted Estrada in 2001. Following his
            removal from office, Estrada was tried for plunder and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007. Despite
            the conviction, then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo granted him a pardon later that year, allowing
            him to return to politics.
        </p>

        <p>
            Estrada’s case underscores the challenges of enforcing accountability in Philippine politics, as well as
            the public’s continuing demand for transparency and justice in governance. To learn more about how
